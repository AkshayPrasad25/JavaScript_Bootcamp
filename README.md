## Assignment 1: Change Background Color

### Task
- Create an HTML document with a title element.
- Add a heading (e.g., `<h1>Click anywhere on the page to change the background color!</h1>`) to explain the assignment's purpose.
- Write a JavaScript function called `getRandomColor()` that generates a random color.
- Write another JavaScript function called `changeBackgroundColor()` that sets the background color of the document's body to the random color obtained from `getRandomColor()`.
- Add an `onclick` event to the entire document that calls the `changeBackgroundColor()` function whenever the user clicks anywhere on the page.
- Test the assignment by opening the HTML document in a web browser. Verify that clicking anywhere on the page changes the background color.

## Assignment 2: Display Names

### Task
- You are provided with an array of 10 Indian names: 
    ```javascript
    const names = [ "Aarav", "Sanya", "Vikram", "Neha", "Rohan", "Priya", "Amit", "Meera", "Rajiv", "Ananya" ];
    ```
- Create a simple web page featuring two buttons: "Next" and "Previous."
- Design an HTML page with a space to display the names and include the "Next" and "Previous" buttons for navigation.
- Upon loading the page, show the first name from the array.
- When the "Next" button is clicked, display the next name in the array. If you reach the end of the array, wrap around to the beginning.
- Clicking the "Previous" button should show the previous name in the array. If you're at the beginning, loop back to the end of the array.

### Usage
- Open `index.html` in a web browser to start the assignment.
- You can navigate through the names using the "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
